## üõ†Ô∏è Setup for Gemini Nano

To use Gemini Nano, your browser needs specific configuration. This application includes a setup modal that guides you, but here's a summary:

1.  **Get Chrome Canary or Dev Channel:**
    *   You need **Chrome Canary (version 131+)** or **Chrome Dev**.
    *   [Download Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/)
    *   [Download Chrome Dev](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/)

2.  **Enable Experimental Flags:**
    *   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://flags`.
    *   Enable the following flag:
        *   `#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` (Set to "Enabled")
    *   Relaunch Chrome after enabling the flags.

3.  **CPU Processing (Optional - If you don't have a powerful GPU):**
    *   If you don't have a dedicated GPU with 4+ GB VRAM, enable this additional flag:
        *   `#optimization-guide-on-device-model-execution-bypass` (Set to "Enabled")
    *   This allows the model to run on your CPU, though performance might be slower.

4.  **System Requirements:**
    *   **OS:** Windows 10/11, macOS 13+, or Linux.
    *   **Storage:** At least 22 GB available for the model.
    *   **GPU:** Dedicated GPU with 4+ GB VRAM (unless CPU bypass is enabled).
    *   **Network:** An unmetered internet connection for the initial model download.

5.  **Verification:**
    *   After setup, you can open Chrome DevTools (F12), go to the Console, and run `await LanguageModel.availability()`. It should return `"available"`.
    *   You can check the model download status at `chrome://components` (look for "Optimization Guide On Device Model").

For the most up-to-date and detailed instructions, please refer to the [official Chrome AI documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/get-started).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration
