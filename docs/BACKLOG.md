# Development Backlog - Gemini Nano Playground

This document outlines refactoring and improvement tasks for the project, organized by priority based on real needs identified through code analysis.

## ðŸ”´ Priority 1 (Critical) - Technical Debt & Core Issues

### 1. Testing Infrastructure

**Status**: Missing  
**Impact**: High risk for regressions, difficult to refactor safely  
**Description**: The project has no test files (`.test.`, `.spec.`) or testing configuration.

**Tasks**:

- Add Vitest configuration for unit testing
- Add React Testing Library for component testing
- Create test setup with jsdom environment
- Add test coverage reporting
- Write tests for critical components: `useGeminiNano`, `App.tsx`, `MarkdownRenderer`

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

### 2. Error Boundary Implementation

**Status**: Missing  
**Impact**: Poor user experience on JavaScript errors  
**Description**: No error boundaries to catch and handle React component errors gracefully.

**Tasks**:

- Implement React Error Boundary component
- Add error boundary around main application
- Create fallback UI for error states
- Add error reporting/logging mechanism

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Status**: Multiple issues identified  
**Impact**: Poor performance on low-end devices  
**Description**: Missing memoization, large bundle size, inefficient re-renders.

**Tasks**:

- Add `React.memo` to pure components
- Implement `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Add bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies
- Optimize React Syntax Highlighter imports (currently imports all languages)
- Implement lazy loading for `GeminiNanoGuide` component

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## ðŸŸ¡ Priority 2 (High) - Code Quality & Maintainability

### 4. Type Safety Improvements

**Status**: Some type safety issues  
**Impact**: Runtime errors, difficult debugging  
**Description**: Missing proper types in some areas, especially around i18n and component props.

**Tasks**:

- Add strict typing for i18n keys (typed translation keys)
- Improve event handler types in components
- Add proper types for Gemini Nano API (extend current types)
- Add generic types for commonly used patterns

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

### 5. Component Architecture Refactoring

**Status**: Large components, tight coupling  
**Impact**: Difficult to maintain and test  
**Description**: `App.tsx` is too large (289 lines), components have too many responsibilities.

**Tasks**:

- Split `App.tsx` into smaller components:
  - `MainLayout.tsx`
  - `ControlPanel.tsx`
  - `ChatInterface.tsx`
  - `TabNavigation.tsx`
- Extract custom hooks from large components
- Implement compound component pattern for complex UI sections
- Add proper component composition patterns

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

### 6. State Management Optimization

**Status**: Complex state in single hook  
**Impact**: Difficult to debug and maintain  
**Description**: `useGeminiNano` hook is doing too much (223 lines), mixing concerns.

**Tasks**:

- Split `useGeminiNano` into multiple hooks:
  - `useModelSession.ts`
  - `useModelStatus.ts`
  - `useModelParameters.ts`
  - `useStreamingResponse.ts`
- Implement proper state machines for model lifecycle
- Add state persistence for user preferences
- Implement proper cleanup patterns

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

## ðŸŸ  Priority 3 (Medium) - Developer Experience

### 7. Development Tooling Enhancement

**Status**: Basic tooling setup  
**Impact**: Slower development, missed issues  
**Description**: Missing advanced development tools and automation.

**Tasks**:

- Add Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- Enhance ESLint rules (add more React-specific rules)
- Add pre-commit hooks with Husky
- Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Add Storybook for component development
- Add TypeScript strict mode gradually

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

### 8. Logging and Debugging

**Status**: Console logs scattered, no proper logging  
**Impact**: Difficult debugging in production  
**Description**: Multiple `console.log` statements found, no centralized logging.

**Tasks**:

- Implement centralized logging system
- Remove debug console.logs from production builds
- Add proper error logging with context
- Implement development-only debug tools
- Add performance monitoring hooks

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

### 9. Internationalization Improvements

**Status**: Working but can be enhanced  
**Impact**: Difficult to add new languages, translation gaps  
**Description**: Large translation files, missing type safety for i18n keys.

**Tasks**:

- Split large translation files into feature-based modules
- Add translation validation scripts
- Implement typed translation keys
- Add missing translations detection
- Add translation extraction tools
- Optimize translation loading (lazy load by feature)

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## ðŸŸ¢ Priority 4 (Low) - Nice to Have

### 10. Code Organization

**Status**: Good structure but can be improved  
**Impact**: Minor maintainability issues  
**Description**: Some files could be better organized.

**Tasks**:

- Create `utils/` directory for helper functions
- Move constants to dedicated `constants/` directory
- Create `providers/` directory for context providers
- Add `services/` directory for API-related logic
- Implement barrel exports consistently

**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day

### 11. Documentation Enhancements

**Status**: Good technical docs, missing code docs  
**Impact**: Harder onboarding for new developers  
**Description**: Missing JSDoc comments and API documentation.

**Tasks**:

- Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- Add README for each major directory
- Create component prop documentation
- Add architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Create troubleshooting guides for developers

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

### 12. Accessibility Improvements

**Status**: Basic accessibility, room for improvement  
**Impact**: Poor experience for users with disabilities  
**Description**: Missing proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation could be better.

**Tasks**:

- Add comprehensive ARIA labels
- Improve keyboard navigation patterns
- Add focus management for modals
- Implement proper color contrast ratios
- Add screen reader testing
- Add accessibility testing tools

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

## Notes

- All tasks should be implemented with backward compatibility in mind
- Breaking changes should be avoided unless absolutely necessary
- Each major refactoring should be done incrementally with proper testing
- Consider feature flags for major architectural changes
- Document architectural decisions in ADRs for future reference
